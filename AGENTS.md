- Use imports (no star imports), whenever possible.
- Produce production-ready code, use best practices, create tests where appropriate, check input parameters to functions/methods,
  use common software engineering patterns where appropriate
- Make sure the resulting code is correct and as we're a DBS we need extreme performant code.
