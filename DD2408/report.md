This is a template for your report. You are free to modify it as needed.
It is not required to use markdown for your report either, but the report
has to be delivered in a standard, cross-platform format.

## Project

Name:

URL:

One or two sentences describing it

## Onboarding experience

The project could easily be built by cloning the repo and following the instructions in the project's readme. 
The required tools to build the project is Java 25 or later, and gradle 9.1 or later. However, gradle was not
necessary to install since you could use the wrapper, and therefore build using ```./gradlew test```. Other tools,
such as plugins, was installed automatically by the build script.

The build sometimes conclude with one error in the tests, and several tests are ignored or skipped. Additionally,
the build can sometimes fail due to different causes. Otherwise, building the project with ```./gradlew build -x test```
succeeds.

## Complexity

1. What are your results for five complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?

## Refactoring

Plan for refactoring complex code:

Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).

Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):

git diff ...

## Coverage

### Tools

Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.

How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?

### Your own coverage tool

Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.

The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:

git diff ...

What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?

### Evaluation

1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?

2. What are the limitations of your own tool?

3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?

## Coverage improvement

Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.

Report of old coverage: [link]

Report of new coverage: [link]

Test cases added:

git diff ...

Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
