/**
 * <h1>CoroutineAxis</h1>
 * <p>
 * Realizes in combination with the <code>CoroutineAxisHelper</code> the concurrent evaluation of
 * pipeline steps. The given axis is embedded in a Coroutine that uses its own transaction and stores all
 * the results in channel. The CoroutineAxis gets the computed results from that channel
 * one by one on every hasNext() call and sets the main-transaction to it.
 * As soon as the end of the computed result sequence is reached (marked by the
 * NULL_NODE_KEY), the CoroutineAxis returns <code>false</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This framework is working according to the producer-consumer-principle, where the
 * CoroutineAxisHelper and its encapsulated axis is the producer and the CoroutineAxis
 * is the consumer. This can be used by any class that implements the IAxis interface. Note:
 * Make sure that the used class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
