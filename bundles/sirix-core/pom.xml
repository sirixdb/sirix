	<description>Sirix is a versioned, treebased storage system. It provides
	an ID-less diff-algorithm to import differences between two versions. Furthermore
	an ID-based diff-algorithm facilitates the comparison of versions stored within
	Sirix. A GUI with several visualizations for comparing these versions visually is
	available to aid an analyst. Versions are stored using well known versioning strategies (full, incremental, differential). 
	The architecture is especially well suited for flash-disks because of a COW-principle. In the future we aim to provide throughout security as
	well as a replaced page-structure to speedup our architecture. A brackit(.org) binding will
	enable XQuery and the XQuery Update Facility. Temporal XPath axis and possibly diff-functions will help analysts to gain quick knowledge from the stored data.</description>
