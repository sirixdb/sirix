	<description>Sirix is a fully java-implemented native XML-Database.
		It supports cursorlike access to all nodes stored in the tree plus
		XPath 2.0 as query engine. Furthermore, Treetank is completely
		versionable. That means that each update-operation results in a new
		version.
		These versions can be easily retrieved within the database itself.
