/**
 * <p>
 * Realizes in combination with the <code>ConurrentAxisHelper</code> the concurrent evaluation of
 * pipeline steps. The given axis is uncoupled from the main thread by embedding it in a Runnable
 * that uses its one transaction and stores all the results to a queue. The ConcurrentAxis gets the
 * computed results from that queue one by one on every hasNext() call and sets the main-transaction
 * to it. As soon as the end of the computed result sequence is reached (marked by the
 * NULL_NODE_KEY), the ConcurrentAxis returns <code>false</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This framework is working according to the producer-consumer-principle, where the
 * ConcurrentAxisHelper and its encapsulated axis is the producer and the ConcurrentAxis with its
 * callees is the consumer. This can be used by any class that implements the IAxis interface. Note:
 * Make sure that the used class is thread-safe.
