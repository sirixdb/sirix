			next call to next().
			Is there any scenario in which the next leaf pointer gets changed and iterator next
			points to a stale leaf?
			No.
			Infact the LeafNode ctor is only ever called in a put and that too for the newer leaf
			to be created/entered.
			So references to an existing LeafNode won't get stale.
