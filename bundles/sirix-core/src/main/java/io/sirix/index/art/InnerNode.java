/*
	These are internal contracts/interfaces
 	They've been written with only what they're used for internally
 	For example InnerNode#remove could have returned a false indicative of a failed remove
 	due to partialKey entry not actually existing, but the return value is of no use in code till now
 	and is sure to be called from places where it'll surely exist.
 	since they're internal, we could change them later if a better contract makes more sense.

	The impls have assert conditions all around to make sure the methods are called being in the right
	state. For example you should not call shrink() if the Node is not ready to shrink, etc.
	Or for example when calling last() on Node16 or higher, we're sure we'll have at least
	X amount of children hence safe to return child[noOfChildren-1], without worrying about bounds.
