 * <h2>Description</h2>

 * <p>
 * Filter the node currently selected by the provided transaction.

 *
 * <h2>Convention</h2>
 *
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Precondition</strong> before each call to <code>Filter.filter()</code>:
 * <code>NodeReadTrx.getNodeKey() == n</code>.</li>
 * <li><strong>Postcondition</strong> after each call to <code>Filter.filter()</code>:
 * <code>NodeReadTrx.getNodeKey() == n</code>.</li>
 * </ol>

 * <h2>User Example</h2>
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * // hasNext() yields true, iff rtx selects an element with local part &quot;foo&quot;.
 * new FilterAxis(new SelfAxis(rtx), new NameFilter(rtx, &quot;foo&quot;));

 *
 *
 * <h2>Developer Example</h2>
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Must extend &lt;code&gt;AbstractFilter&lt;/code&gt; and implement &lt;code&gt;Filter&lt;/code&gt;.
 * public final class ExampleFilter extends AbstractFilter {
