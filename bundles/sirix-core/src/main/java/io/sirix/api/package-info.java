/**
 * sirix API
 * 
 * This package contains the public sirix API. Users will have to connect to any sirix through this
 * API. Note that for common usage, only access-interfaces provided by this package should be used.
 * 
 * <h2>Usage of sirix</h2> sirix is based on three layers of interaction:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IDatabase: This layer denotes a persistent database. Each database can be created using one
 * specific <code>DatabaseConfiguration</code>. Afterwards, this configuration is valid for the
 * whole lifetime of the database.</li>
 * <li>ISession: This layer denotes a runtime access on the database. Only one Session is allowed at
 * one time. The layer has ability to provide runtime-settings as well. Especially settings
 * regarding the transaction-handling can be provided. See <code>SessionConfiguration</code> for
 * more information</li>
 * <li>IReadTransaction/IWriteTransaction: This layer provided direct access to the database. All
 * access to nodes used either a <code>IReadTransaction</code> or <code>IWriteTransaction</code>.
 * </ul>
 * Additional to these access-interfaces, this api-packages provides direct access-methods for the
 * node-structure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>IAxis: This interface is for providing common access to different axis. All axis are listed
 * in the axis-package. The idea is to provide a method for iterating over all nodes denoted by this
 * axis.</li>
 * <li>INode: Each node in the treestructure is encapsulated by this interface.</li>
 * <li>INodeList: To provide common usage of the included XPath 2.0-engine, this interface provides
 * a liste for the resulting items.</li>
 * <li>IFilter: Easy filtering of axis-based node-access is possible with the help if this
 * interface.</li>
 * </ul>
