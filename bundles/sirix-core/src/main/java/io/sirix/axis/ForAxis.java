/**
 * <p>
 * Axis that handles a for expression.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This Axis represents only the single-variable for expression. A multiple variables for expression
 * is created by wrap for-Axes by first expanding the expression to a set of nested for expressions,
 * each of which uses only one variable. For example, the expression for $x in X, $y in Y return $x
 * + $y is expanded to for $x in X return for $y in Y return $x + $y.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a single-variable for expression, the variable is called the range variable, the value of the
 * expression that follows the 'in' keyword is called the binding sequence, and the expression that
 * follows the 'return' keyword is called the return expression. The result of the for expression is
 * obtained by evaluating the return expression once for each item in the binding sequence, with the
 * range variable bound to that item. The resulting sequences are concatenated (as if by the comma
 * operator) in the order of the items in the binding sequence from which they were derived.
 * </p>
